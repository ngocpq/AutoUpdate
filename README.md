# Readme

This repository contains sample code to test the feasibility of our idea, classes designs, as well as supporting libraries.

Our implementing code:
- [DynamicUpdate_Demo](https://github.com/ngocpq/AutoUpdate/tree/master/DynamicUpdate_Demo) folder: contains all of our source code. It contains several sub-projects. You can open all these projects in Visual studio by openning the solution file DynamicUpdate_Demo.sln 

Branches:
- [master](https://github.com/ngocpq/AutoUpdate/tree/master) branch: contains the most stable version that can be ran.
- Other branches are un-finished/developing code: 
  + [client_server](https://github.com/ngocpq/AutoUpdate/tree/client_server) branch: contains implementing that implementing the client-server feature
  + [workspace_manager](https://github.com/ngocpq/AutoUpdate/tree/workspace_manager) branch: developing the feature that automatically recover the working status when the app is restart.
